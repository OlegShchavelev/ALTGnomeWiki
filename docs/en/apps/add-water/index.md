# Add Water

Add Water - allows you to easily customize the Libadwaita (GNOME) theme for the Firefox browser and automatically update it in the background. This theme fits seamlessly into the GNOME design ecosystem and offers many useful features to enhance the user experience:

- Supports light and dark styles for easy viewing;
- Ability to hide the tab bar when only one tab is open;
- The usual black color instead of gray;
- Customizable parameters for the location of the tab bar, controls and alignment;
- Option to hide unnecessary microphones, webcam and screen sharing indicators;
- Supports popular installation formats such as Flatpak, Snap, LibreWolf and Floor.

Designed and maintained by Rafael Mordecai, the GNOME theme for Firefox is a real treat for anyone who appreciates stylish and modern design.
