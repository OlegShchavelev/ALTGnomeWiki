# Amberol

Amberol is a simple music player. Developers are striving to make the player more compact, unobtrusive and simple.

Amberol Philosophy:

- does not manage your music collection;
- does not allow you to manage playlists, smart or otherwise;
- Does not allow you to edit metadata for your songs.

Amberol plays music and nothing else.
