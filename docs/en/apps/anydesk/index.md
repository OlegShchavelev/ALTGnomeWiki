# AnyDesk

AnyDesk is a remote access program that allows users to manage remote computers and servers. It provides a fast and stable connection, and also makes it possible to exchange files between devices. AnyDesk can be used for technical support, training, access to home computers and many other tasks related to remote management and system maintenance.

You can enable the AnyDesk service with the following command:

```shell
serv anydesk on
```

For correct operation, you must install the `libgtkglext` library. It is included in the AnyDesk installation script starting with version [eepm](/package-manager/epm/) `3.62.10`. If you have an earlier version of the package manager installed, you need to install the library separately:

::: code-group

```shell[apt-get]
su -
apt-get update
apt-get install libgtkglext
```

```shell[epm]
epm -i libgtkglext
```
